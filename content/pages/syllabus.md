Course Description
------------------

In this course, we will investigate popular culture and narrative by focusing on the relationship between literary texts and comics. Several questions shape the syllabus and provide a framework for approaching the course materials: How do familiar aspects of comics trace their origins to literary texts and broader cultural concerns? How have classic comics gone on to influence literary fiction? In what ways do contemporary graphic narratives bring a new kind of seriousness of purpose to comics, blurring what's left of the boundaries between the highbrow and the lowbrow? Readings and materials for the course range from the nineteenth century to the present, and include novels, short stories, essays, older and newer comics, and some older and newer films. Expectations include diligent reading, active participation, occasional discussion leading, and two papers.

Course Requirements
-------------------

### Expectations

You are expected to complete the reading, attend class regularly, be an engaged discussion leader and contributor, and be thoughtful and clear in your written work. The class will be at least partly what you make it—lively and informative if you are prepared, something less appealing if you are not.

### Participation

You each will direct two class discussions: one in the first half of the term and the other in the second half. Your job is to pose good questions to the class and generate discussion and debate about the readings and related questions, and to get us to focus on issues that interest you. For these classes you should prepare a 1-page agenda outlining questions, themes, passages, and so on for the rest of us to consider.

### Attendance

Regular attendance is crucial for good work in this course, including being on time to class meetings and attendance at possible film screenings. You are permitted two unexcused absences. Any unexcused absence beyond the second will result in a failing grade in the course. Two latenesses count as one absence.

### Grading

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Papers | 40% |
| Discussion directing and agendas | 30% |
| Participation in class discussion overall (including attendance and reading quizzes) | 30%
